Part I: Basics of Blackjack
1.1) In blackjack, the object of the game is to draw cards and end the game with a 
    hand value that is higher than your opponent, without going over 21.

1.2) Players take turn drawing cards (Hit) and if they are satisfied with their
    hand, they may choose to stop drawing (Stand)
    
1.3) J, Q and K counts as 10
    A counts as either 1 or 11, depending on which is more advantageous

    Example:
    You: 3, 7, 9, 1
    Opponent: J, 4, 2

    You Win. 20 > 16
    (You: 3+7+9+1=20)
    (Opponent: 10+4+2=16) 


    You: J, Q, 4
    Opponent: 2, 9, 8

    You Lose. Your Hand exceeds 21.
    (You: 10+10+4=24)
    (Opponent: 2+9+8=19)


---------------------------


Part II: The Bound
2.1) In GoForX, the number you do not want to exceed is referred to as the "Bound". 
    In Blackjack this number is always 21 but in GoForX this number is different every game.
    Both players will have different bounds. The winner of GoForX is the player whose hand value has
    the shortest distance to their bound.

    Your Hand: 22  Bound: 24
    Your Opponent: 23  Bound: 28

    You Win! 1 < 5
    (You: 24-21=1)
    (Opponent: 28-23=5)


2.2) Players know their opponent's bound but not theirs. Both players' bounds have
    a maximum difference of 3 (referred to as "Variance"). They are told if their
    bound is higher or lower than their opponent. If both players bounds are equal,
    they are randomly shown either "Higher" or "Lower"
    
    For example, if your opponent's bound is 24 and the game tells you your bound is higher
    your bound could be anywhere from 24 to 27.


---------------------------


Part III: The Deck and Your Hand
3.1) In GoForX, the deck consists of only 12 cards. There are no suits. (Spades, Hearts etc.)
    Of those 12 cards, 11 of them are the numbers 2 to 12. (1 copy of each number)

3.2) The 12th card is randomized every game. It is a duplicate of the first 11 cards.
    Example Deck: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

3.3) At the beginning of the game, you and your opponent are dealt 1 card,
    you cannot see your opponent's first card.
